Escape characters
    This is how you use a ' inside of a string. 
    ex. 'Hello! That is bob's cat' does not work.
    Strings can start and end with double quotes instead of single quotes.
    ex. "Hello! That is bob's cat". This works.
    But if you want to use single and double quotes within a string, you will need to use escape characters.
    An escape character consists of a \ followed by a letter that represents which escape character you want to add to the string.
    ex. 'Hello! That is bob\'s cat' will work. The back slash signifies that the character that comes after it is not ending the string.
    Some escape characters are:
        \' = single quote
        \" = double quote
        \t = tab
        \n = new line (break)
        \\ = backslash
    Raw Strings
        If you have text that has many back slashes in it, and you don't want it to be seen as the beginning of an escape character, you can use this.
        A raw string is the exact same as a normal string, but it begins with a lowercase r right before it.
        ex. r'Hello! That is bob\'s cat' will be returned as: 'Hello! That is bob\'s cat'
Multiline strings with triple quotes
    Begins and ends with either ''' or """
    Any quotes, tabs, or new lines between these are considered part of the string.

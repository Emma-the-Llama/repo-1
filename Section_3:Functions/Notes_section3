Built-in Functions
    We already know: print(),input(), len()
    Comes with standard library, full of modules. 
    Modules are python programs that contains a related group of functions that can be used in your programs
    Ex. Math module has math related functions, random module has random number related functions, etc.
    import statements
        You can't use them unless you import them with an import statement.
        Type import, and then the thing you want to import.
        You can import multiple functions at once by seperating them with a comma in the  import statements
        After  doing this, you must type the module + . + function to use the function. Ex. random.randint
        There is another type of import statement:  from (module) impoort *
            ex. from random import *
            This makes it  so you wouldn't need to type the module at the start of the function.
            It is better to use  the other option, because typing the module at the start makes it more  clear.
    Third party modules
        Python comes with it's standard library, but you can also add on more modules.
        You can install them using the pip program. HOW DO YOU DO THIS HELP

Functions
    random
        randint #give  it a range and it gives you a random number in that range.
    sys 
        exit # If you want to stop the program before it reaches the bottom of instructions
    pyperclip
        copy #copies text to clipboard
        paste #returns what is copied on clipboard

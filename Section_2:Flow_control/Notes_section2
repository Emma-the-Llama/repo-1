Boolean values
    Only has two values, unlike integers and strings. These values are True and False.
    Like any other value, boolean values can be used in expressions and stored in variables.
    Make sure to type with capital T and F (True and False), and the rest of the word in lowercase. Don't write it as a string

Comparison operators
    Used in expressions just like the + operator or any other.
    6 comparison operators:
        == Equal to
        != Not equal to
        < Less than
        > Greater than
        <= Less than or equal to
        >= Greater than or equal to
    Evaluate to a boolean value
    Ex. 42 = 42 is True
    Ex. 42 <= -5 is False
    The same string and integer would not be the same, but floats and integers are.
    Ex. 42 != '5' is False
    Ex. 42 != 5.0 is True

Boolean operators
    And operator
        If all of them are True, then it evaluates to True. But if just one is False, it evaluates to False.
        All except True and True is False.
        Ex. True and True is True
        Ex. False and True is False
    Or operator
        Evaluates to True if either or both values are True.
        All except False and False is True.
        Ex. True or False is True
        Ex. False or False is False
    Not operator
        Evaluates to the opposite boolean value.
        Ex. not True is False
        Ex. not False is True
        Unlike And/or, not operates on only one boolean value.

If statement
    Condition is just an expression in a flow control statement
    If the statement is true it enters the indented code that follows, but if it is false it skips it.
Else statement
    If the statement is false, it skips the if statement and goes to the else statement.
    Only one of the if or else blocks can be run. (only one of two blocks is executed)
Elif statement
    Used if you want one of many possible blocks to be executed.
    Lets you provide as many additional conditions to check as you need.
    If the statement is false, it skips the if statement and goes to the elif statements.
    Elif statements are skipped if false, until one of them is true. When it is true, the execution enters inside of that block.
    After one of the elif statements is true, it skips the rest of the elif statements that follow. So the order of elif statements does matter
    You can add an else statement to the end of the elif statements. The else statement will execute if all the previous conditions have been false.

Truthy and Falsey values
    For strings, the blank string is a falsey value, and everything else is truthy.
    For integers 0 is falsey, all others are truthy.
    For floats, 0.0 is falsey, all others are truthy.
    bool() function
        returns 0, 0.0, ' ' as false, and everything else as true.

Blocks
    Indented code is called block.
    A block is made up of lines of code that are indented at the same level.
    New blocks only begin after statements that end in a colon.
